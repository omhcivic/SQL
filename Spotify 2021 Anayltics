# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#What are the average popularity, danceabiity, and energy by artist and track?

SELECT
artist_name,
track_name,
AVG(popularity),
AVG(danceability),
AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#Who are the top 10 artist by popularity?

SELECT

LIMIT 10

#What is the average danceability by artist and track?

SELECT

#What artist released the longest song?

SELECT

#Which song and artist has the highest energy level and the lowest popularity?

SELECT

#Which song is the hardest to dance to?

SELECT

#Which artist(s) appears in the Top 50 list the most?
